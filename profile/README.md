# Preparing for the Everest Base Camp Trek: Essential Packing Guide

If you’re gearing up for the Everest Base Camp trek or any other tea house trek in Nepal, having a well-organized packing list is crucial. Carrying the right clothing, gear, and supplies will enhance your trekking experience and ensure comfort throughout the journey.

## Organizing Your Trekking Gear

For your trek to Everest Base Camp, you will need to pack your belongings in two separate bags:

- **Daypack** – This is the backpack you’ll carry daily with essential items.
- **Duffle Bag** – Carried by porters, this will contain the majority of your gear and be transported from one tea house to the next.

Before starting your trek, you can leave extra luggage at the hotel. Each morning, porters will take your duffle bag to the next stop, and you won’t have access to it until you arrive at your destination in the evening. Therefore, your daypack should contain essentials such as water, snacks, a camera, a headlamp, extra clothing layers, a poncho, and sun protection. Keeping it light will make your trekking experience more enjoyable.

## Layering for Everest Base Camp Trek

As you ascend to higher elevations, temperatures drop significantly. Dressing in layers will help regulate your body temperature.

1. **Base Layer:** Essential for insulation and moisture control. Opt for materials like Merino wool or synthetic fabrics, avoiding cotton.
2. **Middle Layer:** Provides warmth. A down or fleece jacket is ideal.
3. **Outer Layer:** Protects against wind and rain. GORE-TEX jackets are best, but a poncho or nylon jacket can work as a budget-friendly alternative.

## Footwear for the Everest Base Camp Trek

Choosing the right footwear is crucial. A sturdy pair of broken-in hiking boots with ankle support is recommended. Bring lightweight shoes for relaxing in the evenings.

If you usually hike in sneakers, you might be able to manage, but they lack ankle support and warmth. Be sure to break in your boots before the trek to prevent blisters. A good sock combination includes wool hiking socks with lightweight liners to prevent friction.

## Packing Toiletries & Travel Documents

Weight restrictions apply to flights to Lukla and porter loads, so pack only the essentials. While trekking companies provide first aid kits, it’s best to carry your own basic medical supplies.

Make sure to carry:
- **Passport and necessary permits**
- **Cash (at least $200-300) for expenses along the way**
- **A passport-sized photo for permits (if trekking in Annapurna, not required for Everest)**

## Tipping & Budgeting

While there are ATMs along the route, they are often unreliable. Carry enough cash for additional snacks, drinks, or emergency expenses. Tipping guides and porters is customary and should be done at the end of your trek in Lukla.

## Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary

### **Day 1: Arrival in Kathmandu**
Your adventure starts in Nepal’s capital city. Take the day to explore cultural landmarks like:
